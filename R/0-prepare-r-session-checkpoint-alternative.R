# This script will make sure that there will be no error in the replication of 
# the analysis due to R packages absence or version missmatch.
# For this reason we use the special package for reproducible research called 
# "checkpoint".
# This package installes all the packages used in a project precisely as they 
# were at a specific date, the date of abalysis. 
# More info: https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/checkpoint/wiki


# install "checkpoint" package with all its dependencies 
# install only if it was not previously installed

# Set the checkpoint date for reproducibility: 2018-05-23
# Now quite a long process starts: "checkpoint" scans through all the scripts in 
# the project and finds all the packages that should be installed to run the scripts.
# The packages will be installed precisely as the were on 2018-05-23.
